                    enforcement in police pursuits. The series released its first title, The Need for Speed, in 1994.
                    The most recent game, Need for Speed Heat, was released on November 8, 2019.

                    The series has been overseen and had games developed by multiple notable teams over the years
                    including EA Black Box and Ghost Games. The franchise has been critically well received and is one
                    of the most successful video game franchises of all time, selling over 150 million copies of
                    games. Due to its strong sales, the franchise has expanded into other forms of media including a
                    film adaptation and licensed Hot Wheels toys. "<br><br>
