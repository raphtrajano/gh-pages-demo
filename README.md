# GH pages demo site

This is a demo website developed to test Github Pages features. I  made it after watching Udemy's  [Git and GitHub pages course](https://www.udemy.com/course/github-pages/learn/lecture/5336318#announcements). The main goal of the course was to learn how to host a simple website using the GitHub hosting service. Instead of using the same website template provided by the instructor, I decided to create an entirely new website, using the knowledge learned from two other Udemy courses that I was doing at the same time [Introduction of HTML](https://www.udemy.com/course/introducao-a-linguagem-html/learn/) and  [introduction of CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/introducao-a-linguagem-css/learn/lecture/11902866#announcements). 
The website is very simple, and its main theme is based on the NFS game, because I love this franchise since I was a kid.
